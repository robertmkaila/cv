    <p>Here's when I went up to Moro to troubleshoot and repair a machine for Oil Search Ltd. Can you pick out the little canoe
    in the pic? At that time a local tune was becoming an hit in the airwaves. A song titled; Raun Wara by the group Wame Blood
  and the song was dedicted to this exact lake. Looking from above I couldn't help being mesmerized by the over-whelming feeling
of pride. Pride for my beautiful country, that co-exhisted with the natural environment.</p>

    <p>Did I mention sunsets? Here's one of the sunsets in my life from across the Kieta Habour.</p>
